# Hi there! I'm David* 👋
I'm a full-stack web developer and computer science educator based in Houston, Texas. 🤠 

Aside from being a developer, I've worked as a computer science teacher at [The Nueva School](https://www.nuevaschool.org/) and [The Kinkaid School](https://www.kinkaid.org/). Before that, I worked as in tech policy at the [San Jose MOTI](https://www.motisanjose.org/) and the [Aspen Tech Policy Hub](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/). I love the creative possibilities of technology, especially as a tool for education! 

Recently I've decided to deepen my technical expertise. Over the summer of 2023, I completed a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) 🏋️‍♂️ 💻  and I am enrolled in a Master's in Computer Science program at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) 🐝 💻

## Things I'm Doing:

- 🔨 Creating a platform to teach computer science basic concepts through building 'Karel the Robot' type puzzles with [karel worlds](https://github.com/dalbanhi/karel-worlds). Read about it on my portfolio here: [Karel Worlds](https://david-alban.com/projects/karelWorlds).
- 💭 Iterating on [GitNote](https://github.com/dalbanhi/git-note), an 'external brain' repository for my web dev learning journey. Read about it on my portfolio here: [GitNote](https://david-alban.com/projects/gitNote).
