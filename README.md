### Hi there! I'm David* 👋
I'm an educator and technologist based in Houston, Texas. 🤠

I've worked in tech policy at the [San Jose MOTI](https://www.motisanjose.org/) and the [Aspen Tech Policy Hub](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/), as well as a computer science teacher at [The Nueva School](https://www.nuevaschool.org/) and [The Kinkaid School](https://www.kinkaid.org/). I love the creative possibilities of technology, especially as a tool for education! 

Recently I've decided to deepen my technical expertise. Over the summer of 2023, I completed a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). 🏋️‍♂️ 💻
