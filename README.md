### Hi there! I'm David* 👋
I'm a full-stack web developer and computer science educator based in Houston, Texas. 🤠

I've worked in tech policy at the [San Jose MOTI](https://www.motisanjose.org/) and the [Aspen Tech Policy Hub](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/), as well as a computer science teacher at [The Nueva School](https://www.nuevaschool.org/) and [The Kinkaid School](https://www.kinkaid.org/). I love the creative possibilities of technology, especially as a tool for education! 

Recently I've decided to deepen my technical expertise. Over the summer of 2023, I completed a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) 🏋️‍♂️ 💻  and I am enrolled in a Master's in Computer Science program at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) 🐝 💻

##### Things I'm Doing:


- 📖 Currently transitioning my reading habit tracker app, [bibbl.io](https://github.com/dalbanhi/bibbl.io) for production/deployment
- 🔨 Creating a platform to teach computer science basic concepts through building 'Karel the Robot' type puzzles [karel worlds](https://github.com/dalbanhi/karel-worlds)
- 🌱 Collaborating on the [TeamWyrk app](https://github.com/noscenthairspray/Teamwyrk), a platform to help people trying to break into the tech industry
